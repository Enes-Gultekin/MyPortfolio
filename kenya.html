          <p>
            This project addresses the need for long-term, consistent monitoring of forest dynamics in Kenya.
            Using a 20-year Landsat time series (2001–2021), I processed satellite imagery into analysis-ready
            data with FORCE and applied Random Forest classification to map land cover and quantify forest
            gain, loss, and stability across protected areas and surrounding buffers.
          </p>

          <h3>Data & Preprocessing</h3>
          <p>
            Landsat scenes were processed in FORCE to create Analysis Ready Data (ARD) and Highly Analysis-Ready Data (hARD).
            The workflow includes cloud/shadow masking (Fmask), atmospheric and topographic correction, and data cubing
            to ensure that spectral signatures are comparable through time.
          </p>

          </div>

          <p>
            From the spectral bands (Blue, Green, Red, NIR, SWIR-1, SWIR-2), indices such as NDVI and EVI were derived
            to separate forest from agriculture and degraded/bare forest patterns more robustly.
          </p>

          <h2>Methodology</h2>
          <p>
            Implemented a supervised Random Forest classifier using multi-temporal spectral-temporal metrics
            (annual summaries of bands and indices). Using temporal information rather than single-date snapshots
            improves class separability and reduces noise from seasonal variability.

          </div>

          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>
            The Random Forest classification outputs were recoded into forest / non-forest and used to quantify
            forest gain, loss, and stable forest across the study period. Validation using a confusion-matrix-based
            assessment yielded an overall accuracy of 84%.
          </p>

          <p>
            The results show a strong gain signal around 2015 (~33,924 ha), followed by a reversal with high forest loss
            in 2020 (~15,118.92 ha). Possible drivers include land-use expansion, deforestation pressure, and degradation
            reflected in the “bare forest” category.
