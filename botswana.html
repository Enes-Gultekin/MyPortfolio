          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            This project examines how rainfall influences vegetation dynamics in
            Botswana, including delayed (lagged) effects on NDVI anomalies. A
            Distributed Lag Model (DLM) identifies where vegetation is sensitive
            to rainfall and which time lags matter most. A random forest model
            then explains spatial variability in sensitivity using terrain and
            climate variables.
          </p>

          <!-- OBJECTIVES -->
          <h3>Objectives</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Fit a Distributed Lag Model (DLM) to quantify rainfall influence
              across lag months.
            </li>
            <li>

          <!-- STEP 1 -->
          <h3>Step 1: Distributed Lag Model (DLM)</h3>
          <p>
            The DLM was used to model how rainfall affects NDVI anomalies across
            multiple lag months. Spatial outputs were analyzed to locate
            sensitive regions and identify the most informative lags.
          </p>

          <h4>Key Observations</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Sensitive areas</strong> (higher model response) were
              mainly located in the <strong>south-east of Botswana</strong>,
              with additional isolated areas elsewhere.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Most obvious rainfall influence</strong> occurred at
              <strong>lag 3 and lag 4</strong> (months).
            </li>
          </ul>



          <br /><br />

          <!-- STEP 2 -->
          <h3>
            Step 2: Explaining Sensitivity with Random Forest (Regression)
          </h3>
          <p>
            The DLM outputs (F-values) were used as a target variable to explore
            relationships with environmental drivers. Terrain variables were
            derived from a DEM (e.g., slope, aspect, roughness, flow direction,
            TRI, TPI) and combined with climate/topographic measures (e.g.,
            aridity, LST, evapotranspiration, TWI, vertical distance to
            channels).
          </p>

          <h4>Sampling & Data Cleaning</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Random sampling: <strong>25,000 training</strong> +
              <strong>25,000 validation</strong> pixels (50,000 total).
            </li>
            <li>
              Null values were removed to reduce bias and improve model
              stability.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Most Important Variables (Regression)</h4>
          <p>
            Variable importance indicated <strong>aridity</strong> as the
            strongest driver of NDVI–rainfall sensitivity, followed by
            <strong>elevation</strong>,
            <strong>land surface temperature</strong>, and
            <strong>evapotranspiration</strong>.
            <strong>Flow direction</strong> showed the lowest influence.
          </p>

          <!-- STEP 3 -->
          <h3>Step 3: Classification of Significant Lag-3 Relationships</h3>
          <p>
            A random forest classifier was trained to predict whether lag-3
            relationships were significant (5% threshold) based on the
            environmental raster layers. The same key variables remained
            dominant (aridity, elevation, evapotranspiration, land surface
            temperature).
          </p>

          <h4>Classification Performance (Key Numbers)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Non-significant pixels:</strong> ~96.73% correctly
              predicted (very strong).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Significant pixels:</strong> ~34.05% correctly predicted
              (weak; many false negatives).
            </li>
            <li>
              The model tended to over/under-estimate class membership,
              reflecting imbalance and confusion in detection.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <!-- RESULTS -->
          <h3>Results</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Strongest rainfall influence on NDVI appears after
              <strong>3–4 months</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Aridity</strong> consistently explains spatial differences
              in NDVI–rainfall sensitivity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Regression explanations are strong, but classification struggles
              to detect the minority “significant” class.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <!-- CONCLUSION -->
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            The workflow links climate forcing to vegetation response using
            lag-aware modeling, then explains sensitivity using environmental
            context. Findings suggest that delayed rainfall effects are
            strongest at lag 3–4, and that aridity and energy/water-balance
            variables are key drivers. For classification tasks, improving
            minority-class detection would likely require balancing strategies,
            threshold tuning, or alternative metrics.
